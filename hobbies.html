                        I've been playing and watching football since 5 years old. My uncle and grandpa watches football weekly and that's
                        how I got introduced to football, the ever match I saw was a

                        match between 
                        <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en">Chelsea</a> 
                        and Liverpool, which is how
                        I started supporting Chelsea, they were wearing blue jearseys and my favorite color is blue, I have never changed the club I supporting
                        since then. After that I started playing football with my friends and started playing games related to football. My parents also bought
                        me jerseys which also made me want to collect jerseys. I continued expanding my collection during 2023 buying both offical and replica jerseys.

                        Playing games might be the activity I gave most of my time into. My second most costly
                        hobby second to collecting history books, would be in the first place if my parents
                        didn't disencourage to spend money on games. I have joined esports tournments in the past 
                        with my friends. I mostly play, first person shooter, moba, historical stradegy and horror games.
                        The games I mostly play are

                        I've been reading history since I was a kid. I used to not have good grades during school.
                        History is one of the only few subjects I can get an A at. Not just from school I also read history books
                        during my free time, either physical books or ebooks. I prefer physical books over ebooks and try to get
                        the physical version as much as I can as a way to collect and it also reduces my screen time. Buying history books
                        is probably the hobby I spent the most money at.
